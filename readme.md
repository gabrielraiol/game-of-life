<p>This was a challenge proposed by a friend so that I could train my knowledge in logic and JavaScript. Conway's game of life is a cellular automaton and takes place in an infinite two-dimensional arrangement of cells that can be in one of two states, alive or dead. Each cell interacts with its eight neighbors, the horizontally, vertically and diagonally adjacent cells. The game evolves in discrete units of time called generations. With each new generation, the game state is updated by applying the following rules:</p>
<p>1 - Every dead cell with exactly three living neighbors becomes alive (birth).</br>
2 - Every living cell with less than two living neighbors dies from isolation.</br>
3 - Every living cell with more than three living neighbors dies from overpopulation.</br>
4 - Every living cell with two or three living neighbors remains alive.</br>

<p>It was a difficult process, but as the visual result can be a fixed pattern repeat or something chaotic, it was really cool to see it work. I hope you enjoy!</p>
